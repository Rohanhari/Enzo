The code runs a (non-nested) grid with dark matter and baryon gas coupled. There are separate files for adiabatic case without adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and one with AMR. There is also a file with the inital conditions given, do alter it for your case. This is a modified version of the test case, there is also a dark matter only file for convenience. plots.py is for rendering an image and scripts.py is for the plots from the output after the code is run. 
You would need the yt toolkit to render and work on the post-processing.
