The code is an approximate model given in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6123. It has been refined based on my system configuration and speed, hence can be considered as a just trial version and not to test the accuracy of the code. Do change the refinement and try to run it with the help of MUSIC for accurate 3D rendering.
