Some codes on the Enzo tool 
This repository contains some codes which I ran using ENZO. It is Cosmological Simulations of dark matter, and dark matter + baryons simulations with different setup than that of the test cases. 3-D simulations are run with MUSIC, and python scripts to visualise. There is also an approximated model of this paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6123, tried to run it but considering my system configurations and limitations, it was more trial based than a need for an accurate result.
